friendlys is a game mode where you can play with your friends 
and have fun.You can use your team and he can use his 
it's 11v11 and after the game you get coins and with those coins 
you can buy better players and upgrade your team and beat your friends 
but to play friendlys you need something called plus. When I play with my 
friends we talk smack about each other when someone loses.
